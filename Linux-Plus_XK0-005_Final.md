## Important Linux Files   


- `/boot/vmlinuz` : The Linux Kernel file.
- `/dev/hda` : Device file for the first IDE HDD (Hard Disk Drive).
- `/dev/hdc` : Device file for the IDE Cdrom, commonly.
- `/dev/sda`: Device file for the first SATA Drive (Hard Disk Drive).
- `/dev/null` : A pseudo-device, that doesn’t exist. Sometimes garbage output is redirected to /dev/null, so that it gets lost, forever.
- `/etc/bashrc` : This file contains system-wide defaults, functions, and aliases among other files that are used by all the system users.
-`/etc/crontab` : This is a system-wide file that is uniquely formatted to schedule or automate system tasks on a Linux system.
- `/etc/exports` : A file that determines which file systems are exported to remote hosts and specifies options.
- `/etc/fstab` : This is a special file that contains information about all avaiable mount points and mount point options. Each line in this file provides six options, each of which denotes information about a mount point or filesystem.
- `/etc/hosts` : This is a configuration file that maps system hostnames to their corresponding IP addresses.
- `/etc/hosts.allow` : The file specifies which hosts are permitted to connect to the local system.
- `/etc/host.deny` : The file specifies which hosts are denied access and services on the local machine.
- `/etc/issue` : Contains a pre-login message.
- `/etc/modules` : This file contains the names of kernel modules that should be loaded at boot time, one per line.
- `/etc/motd` : motd stands for a message of the day, the message users get upon login.
- `/etc/mtab` : A read-only file that contains a list of currently mounted filesystems.
- `/etc/passwd` : A file that contains the system user’s information such as the username, UID, GID, and login shell among others
- `/etc/printcap` : Contains printer information that is generated by the /etc/cups/printers.conf file.
- `/etc/profile` : Contains Linux system-wide environment and other startup scripts.
- `/etc/profile.d` : Application script, executed after login.
- `/etc/rc.d` : Information about run level specific script.
- `/etc/rc.d/init.d` : Run Level Initialisation Script.
- `/etc/resolv.conf` : This is a DNS resolver file. It specifies how the system leverages DNS to resolve hostnames.
- `/etc/security` : Contains configuration files for various PAM modules.
- `/etc/skel` : This is a directory that contains a set of user configuration files that are copied to the user’s home directory when a user is created.
- `/etc/X11` : This is a directory that contains configuration files for the X-window System.
- `/usr/bin` : Normal user executable commands.
- `/usr/bin/X11` : This directory contains infinitely nested directories and binaries for the X Windows System.
- `/usr/include` : The directory contains header files for C compilers. This includes stdio.h, stdlib.h, and string.h among others.
- `/usr/share` : Shared directories of man files, info files, etc.
- `/usr/lib` : This directory consists of object files and directories
- `/usr/sbin` : The directory contains binaries with superuser privileges or for System Administration.
- `/proc/cpuinfo` : The file contains system info including CPU model, model name, number of cores, and clock speed to mention a few files.
- `/proc/interrupts` : Information about the current interrupts being utilized currently.
- `/proc/ioports` : The file contains all the Input/Output addresses used by devices on the server.
- `/proc/meminfo` : A file that stores memory usage information including swap information.
- `/proc/modules` : A file that lists all the modules being used by the kernel
- `/proc/mount` : The file contains detailed mounted file-system information.
- `/proc/stat` : The file contains detailed information about the system and kernel activity.
- `/proc/swaps` : The file contains information about the swap file.
- `/proc/version` : The file contains Linux version information.
- `/var/log/lastlog` : A binary file that contains information about the last successful user logins.
- `/var/log/messages` : The file contains a log of messages produced by the syslog daemon at boot.
- `/var/log/syslog` : A file that contains non-critical system logs.
- `/var/log/wtmp` : A file listing the login time and duration of each user on the system currently.

# Linux Basics  

In a UNIX or Linux system everything is considered a file.  If not a file then it must be a running process.  

3 broad catagories of files in Linux  
- General files - binary or ASCII data - documents, images, audio, video, etc  
- Directory files - Linux directories are also files since they also serve as storage space for other files and folders.  
- Device files - `/dev` directory - Special files that provide an interface to device drivers which enables hardware.
